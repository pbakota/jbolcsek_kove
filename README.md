### Javascript port of Commodore +4 game called "A Bölcsek köve"

This is a javascript port of the old Commodore +4 game called ["A Bölcsek köve"](http://plus4world.powweb.com/software/Bolcsek_Kove), in translation "Stone of sages". The original game was written by [Miklós Tihor](http://plus4world.powweb.com/members/Miklos_Tihor), who has besides this masterpiece other interesting games as well. I tried to reproduce the gameplay very closely to the original; there are only some minor differences (I hope so :)). The game itself is an RPG genre game from the old days. Short prolog from the plus4world site:

> Humanity needs the Stone of Sages back from where it has been hidden in ancient times, in order to defeat Zaarlo and give a cut to his domination over the world. To
> achieve this mission, you must be able to learn how to change your own body to let you survive and move in the four elements: on the ground, under the water, into
> the lava, up to the skies. As an angel, you can fly to the floating house where the Stone has been kept away from harmful hands.
> This project was made possible with the sources from these great authors
